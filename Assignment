Total points: 15
1.	(2 points) Make a copy of Pr8-17.cpp and call it arrayFunctions.cpp. 
2.	(5 points) Add a function with the following prototype:
int highestofElements(int [], int)
that will find and return the highest element of the array. Hint: You may consult slide 2 of Module 1-> CMPS1063_Lect04_1044_Review_Passing_Arrays_to_Functions.pptx.
3.	(5 points) Call this function after the call to showValues(). The return of the function should be either saved in a variable or cout-ed.
4.	(3 points) Print the highest element, as shown below.

Your output should look like:
